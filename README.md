# rtl_geo_heatmap
This repository will have the code of an rf signal strenth mapping tool (using an RTL dongle and a GPS for recording.
The code is writin in Python3
# Project Status.
The project just started 8 Feb 2023
Not all the fucktionality is working yet.

# Description of what this Application will do.
If you use and RTL-SDR donge and a USB GPS you can then connect this to a laptop with an external mobile antenna and the application will map the RF signel strenth of a transmitter on a map.
The Map will have hotspot overys of the signal strenth of the transmitter that you recored with this aplication.
